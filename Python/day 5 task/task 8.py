Task8:
=======
In English, present participle is formed by adding suffix-ing to infinite form: go->
going. A simple set of heuristic rules can be given as follows:

a)If the verb ends in e, drop the e and add ing
(if not exception be, see, flee, knee, etc.)

b) If the verb ends in ie, change ie to y and add ing

c)For words consisting of consonant-vowel-consonant, double the final
letter before adding ing

d) By default, just add ing
Your task in this exercise is to define a function make_ing_form() which given a verb in
infinitive form returns its present participle form. Test your function with words such as
lie, see, move and hug. However, you must not expect such simple rules to work for all
cases.
