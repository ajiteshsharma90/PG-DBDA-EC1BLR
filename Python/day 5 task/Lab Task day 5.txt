 Lab Task:
==========
 Task1:
========
 f1 = open("data.csv", "w")
 f1.write("name,loc,salary\n")
 f1.write("arun,blr,25000\n")
 f1.write("hari,chn,45000\n")
 f1.write("john,mum,30000\n")
 f1.write("manu,hyd,35000")
 f1.close()
 >>run the above program- it will create a csv file
 >>read the csv file store this data in a DATABASE TABLE

 Task2:
=======
 From the DATABASE TABLE, READ THE TABLE contents and
 store them in a text file

 Task3:
=======
 Write program to find the most repeated word in a file
 Assume the file "data.txt" contains----------------------------------
this that this this this that
 then that that that
 that this then that
 Expected:----------
Most repeated word in the file is = this

 Task4:
=======
 Define a function overlapping () that takes two lists and returns True
 if they have at least one member in common, False otherwise.

 Task5:
=======
 Write a function find_longest_word() that takes a list of words and returns the
 length of the longest one.

 Task6:
=======
 Write a function filter_long_words() that takes a list of words and an integer n
 and returns the list of words that are longer than n

 Task7:
=======
 Define a simple "spelling correction" function correct ()
 that takes a string and sees to it that
 1)two or more occurrences of the space character is compressed into one, and
 2)inserts an extra space after a period if the period is
 directly followed by a letter.
 e.g. correct ("This is very funny and cool.Indeed!") should return
 "This is very funny and cool. Indeed!"

 Task8:
=======
 In English, present participle is formed by adding suffix-ing to infinite form: go->
 going. A simple set of heuristic rules can be given as follows:
 a)If the verb ends in e, drop the e and add ing
 (if not exception be, see, flee, knee, etc.)
 b) If the verb ends in ie, change ie to y and add ing
 c)For words consisting of consonant-vowel-consonant, double the final
 letter before adding ing
 d) By default, just add ing
 Your task in this exercise is to define a function make_ing_form() which given a verb in
infinitive form returns its present participle form. Test your function with words such as
 lie, see, move and hug. However, you must not expect such simple rules to work for all
 cases.

 Task9:
=======
 Write a program to display the first and last word of a given file
 Enter a filename : one.txt
 contents of one.txt:----------------------
 hello world of unix was
 the output of the above
 program which was given
 Expected output is :----------------------
 hello- was
 the- above
 program- given

 Task10:
========
 write a program to convert the file contents of upper case
 Enter the file name : one.txt
 Enter the output file : out.txt
 contents of one.txt:----------------------
 hello world of unix was
 the output of the above
 program which was given
