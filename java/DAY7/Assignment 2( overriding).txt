 Problem Statement: Library Management System
Objective: Develop a library management system that categorizes different types of books (e.g., Fiction, Non-Fiction, and Reference). Each book type should have its own method to display borrowing rules.

Logic-Building Method for Overriding:
Define a Superclass: Create a superclass Book with a method displayBorrowingRules().
Subclass Implementation: Create subclasses (Fiction, NonFiction, Reference) that override displayBorrowingRules() to provide specific rules for borrowing each type of book.
Polymorphism: Maintain a list of Book objects and call displayBorrowingRules() to demonstrate overridden behaviors.


2. Problem Statement: Employee Management System
Objective: Create an employee management system that manages different employee roles (e.g., Manager, Engineer, and Intern). Each role should provide its own method to calculate bonuses.

Logic-Building Method for Overriding:
Superclass Definition: Define a superclass Employee with a method calculateBonus().
Subclass Specialization: Implement subclasses (Manager, Engineer, Intern) that override calculateBonus() to implement role-specific bonus calculations.
Dynamic Binding: Use an array of Employee references to calculate bonuses for different roles using polymorphism.


3. Problem Statement: Animal Rescue Center
Objective: Design a system for an animal rescue center that manages different animal types (e.g., Dog, Cat, and Bird). Each animal type should have its own method to describe care requirements.

Logic-Building Method for Overriding:
Common Superclass: Create a superclass Animal with a method describeCareRequirements().
Subclass Customization: Define subclasses (Dog, Cat, Bird) that override describeCareRequirements() to provide specific care instructions for each animal type.
Care Instructions: Create a collection of Animal objects and invoke describeCareRequirements() to display care instructions for each type.


4. Problem Statement: Online Course Management System
Objective: Build a system that manages different course types (e.g., LiveCourse, RecordedCourse, and Workshop). Each course type should provide its own method to calculate enrollment fees.

Logic-Building Method for Overriding:
Superclass Structure: Define a superclass Course with a method calculateEnrollmentFee().
Subclass Implementation: Implement subclasses (LiveCourse, RecordedCourse, Workshop) that override calculateEnrollmentFee() to specify different fee structures.
Fee Calculation: Maintain a list of Course objects and use polymorphism to calculate and display enrollment fees.

5. Problem Statement: E-Commerce Payment System
Objective: Develop an e-commerce system that handles various payment methods (e.g., CreditCardPayment, PayPalPayment, and GiftCardPayment). Each payment method should implement its own processing logic.

Logic-Building Method for Overriding:
Common Superclass: Create a superclass Payment with a method processPayment().
Subclass Specialization: Create subclasses (CreditCardPayment, PayPalPayment, GiftCardPayment) that override processPayment() to implement unique processing logic for each payment method.
Payment Processing: Use a list of Payment references to process payments and demonstrate overridden behaviors.
