author (String)
isAvailable (boolean)
Write a program that uses an ArrayList<Book> to manage the library's collection. The program should allow the following operations:

Add new books to the collection.
Remove a book from the collection based on the title.
Mark a book as issued or returned based on the title.
Display all available books in the library.


Problem 2: Order Management System using ArrayList
Objective: Create a system to track customer orders in a shopping system, where each order has an order ID, customer name, and list of products.

Problem Statement: Implement an Order class with the following attributes:

orderID (String)
customerName (String)
products (ArrayList<String>)
Use an ArrayList<Order> to store and manage customer orders. The program should allow the following operations:

Add a new order.
Remove an order based on the order ID.
Add or remove products from a specific order.
Display all orders placed by a particular customer.


Problem 3: Product Inventory Management using HashMap
Objective: Build a system to manage product inventory in a warehouse, where each product has an ID, name, and stock quantity.

Problem Statement: Create a Product class with the following attributes:

productID (String)
productName (String)
quantity (int)
Use a HashMap<String, Product> to store the product inventory, where the key is the productID and the value is the Product object. The program should allow the following operations:

Add new products to the inventory.
Update the quantity of a product based on its product ID.
Remove a product from the inventory.
Display the stock levels for all products.


Problem 4: Course Registration System using HashMap
Objective: Develop a system to manage student registrations for different courses, where each course has a course code, course name, and a list of enrolled students.

Problem Statement: Create a Course class with the following attributes:

courseCode (String)
courseName (String)
enrolledStudents (ArrayList<String>)
Use a HashMap<String, Course> to manage courses, where the key is the courseCode and the value is the Course object. The program should support the following operations:

Add a new course.
Register a student for a course.
Display all students enrolled in a particular course.
